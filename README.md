## BMI ML Analysis
## Abstract:
The project takes a publicly available dataset containing age, height, and weight and aims at classifying people according to their body mass index (BMI) categories. Python was used for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and creating visualizations to the data patterns. A Logistic Regression model was trained to categorize BMI, thus demonstrating a complete machine learning workflow.

## Project Highlights:
Use of pandas for data exploration and statistical summaries
Visual investigation with seaborn/matplotlib
BMI categorization model built with Logistic Regression
Demonstrates an end-to-end ML workflow from data handling to prediction

## Note for Readers:
This dataset is quite small; hence, the model's accuracy should be considered as an illustration only. The approach can be used with larger datasets to obtain more accurate BMI or health predictions.

## Usage:
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bmi-ml-analysis.git

Open analysis.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.

Execute each cell to get familiar with the data, interpret the visualizations, and view the BMI predictions.
